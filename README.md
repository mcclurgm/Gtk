# My Repo for Learning Gtk
I want to learn to write apps for GTK+ so I can do things with open source. This is where I put all my tutorials and basic practice projects.
So far, I'm working on Python. I also want to learn Vala, but I don't know the language so I figured I'd start with one I know. Toolkit, then new language; not both at once.

I have yet to create an actual GNOME project, doing just basic Python files that import Gtk (and Gio). That will come later, again.
